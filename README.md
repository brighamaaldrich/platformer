AUTHORS:        Brigham Aldrich
DESCRIPTION:    Basic 2D Platformer with level builder made with Python and PyGame
DEPENDENCIES:   Python 3.XX, PyGame 2.6.1

INFO:           Running main.py will play through all level files in the levels folder in sequence then it will repeat.
                Running level_builder.py opens the level editor where blocks can be added (clicking and dragging) or deleted (right click).
                The start and end points can be added by holding control while clicking and dragging (end only gets set if there is already a start) and deleted with right click.
                Note that the FPS and/or gravity/jump power may need to be adjusted depending on the machine running the program to get realistic physics.

DIRECTIONS:     To play simply use the left and right arrow keys to move and the up arrow key to jump.
                Try to reach the end point (red) to move on to the next level.
                Build new levels for yourself to keep it interesting!
